This is very primitive Ionic 2/3 App with creating doctor's clinic record by just taking photo  

Fire base is used as back end.   

As this demo  is developed within 3 days contains many bugs. 

Near future enhancement 
1. Better Navigation 
2. Better UX designing 
3. Include Compression in webapp  
4. Include Camera Plugin is Cordova App  
5. More Feature like more patients information + Clinical information 
6. Patient's Record Navigation System to View Patient's Data and others.  
7. Compliance to Medical Record Keeping Standard. 


At the Same time I am willing to contribute  with Medical Record Keeping software Development in  
Angular/Ionic/React/ReactNative projects upto full fleged Medical Science integration in software
